# Toyota API Client

A TypeScript-native, unofficial API client that retrieves data on Toyota vehicles, directly from toyota.com.

## Quickstart

```sh
$ npm install @camrymps/toyota-client-v2
```

## Documentation

Documentation is located [here](http://camrymps.github.io/toyota-client-v2).

## Important note

This client replaces the now deprecated [toyota-client](https://github.com/camrymps/toyota-client).

## Disclaimer

While this client retrieves data directly from Toyota's website, it is **not an official Toyota client**. **This client is meant to be used for learning purposes only**. **Use it at your own risk** and, as always, be respectful of Toyota's servers.
